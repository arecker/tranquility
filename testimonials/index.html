		  <h2>TESTIMONIALS</h2>

		    <em>"We were very fortunate to meet Renee two years ago when our local livelihood was uncertain and we decided to prepare our home for sale on a budget. Renee is a skilled professional with a fabulous eye for quality, color and design. She is well connected with area businesses and was able to quickly recommend the best one or two businesses for our needs (lighting, flooring, etc). We were free to use our own choices, but Renee’s picks combined high quality, low cost and reliable schedules. Renee also connected us with local tradespeople (painters, carpenters, etc) – again with high quality, low cost and reliable schedules. Renee was very quick about responding to our calls or email, stopping by and doing promised leg work for us. She can pack a LOT of progress into each hour! She is there for large projects or small. She helped us complete a major kitchen remodel in 2012. She has helped us with exterior design (siding, landscaping) through area businesses in 2013 and 2014. We plan to remodel two bathrooms with her in the future. Renee is a pleasure to work with – but more than that, she brings a sense of tranquility and peace as you feel your project is in good hands and your dollars are being spent wisely

		    <em>"We first met Renee just over 2 years ago after moving into our new home. We were overwhelmed with increased space and both small and large design changes that needed to be made to suit our young family’s needs and tastes. It was our first experience using an interior designer, and I admit we were slightly nervous that it would be an expensive endeavor. Working with Renee has been a joy. She has not only saved us so much time by selecting and purchasing items for us, but she has also actually saved us money. I appreciate that Renee seeks to select items that are not only beautiful, but are cost-conscious. She takes the time to understand our personal vision and tastes, and has brought so much beauty into our home. Renee has also been an invaluable resource for connecting us with local vendors and contractors as we remodel our basement. When we ran into glitches with cabinetry and flooring, she personally made phone calls on our behalf to make sure each job was done correctly and within the agreed upon budget. She continues to work with us at our own pace on projects throughout our home. The icing on the cake is that Renee is a genuinely nice person. She is incredibly personable, professional, and honest. I cannot imagine choosing anyone else to help us make our home a lovely and inviting space.

		    <em>"We have worked with Renee on several large renovation projects in our home. Each time, she listens attentively to our objectives for the spaces and then walks alongside us to help us meet our goals. She is an effective communicator who consistently returns emails and phone calls. Because of her many years of experience, she has developed strong relationships with quality people in the fields of construction and design. Over and over, her work has saved us both time and money. Her design expertise is invaluable, and her enthusiasm for design is contagious. We have had great experiences working with Renee and we couldn’t be more pleased with the beautiful results.
